# Foodie
Front-end capstone

## Description
For the front-end portion of my course, I have created Foodie, an advanced recipe resource and meal planning app.  Using the Spoonacular Recipe API, this allows users to search for and save their favorite recipes and products.  Features include multiple search options, such as Advanced Search and "What's in my fridge", where users can search for recipes based on what they have on hand.

### Technologies Used:
* AngularJS
* Firebase
* Spoonacular Recipe API
* Angular Material
